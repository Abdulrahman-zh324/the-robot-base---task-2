# the-robot-base---task-2

To design the base for the robot arm I designed the pieces on solidworks and assembled the pieces on Cinema 4d

At first, I designed the tire from the inside (rims) and designed an outer tire to make the wheel capable of absorbing the shocks of the uneven road

Then I collected it and repeated it four times to make the base with 4 wheels so that the movement of the body is easier and more smooth

The base is designed, hollowed out from the bottom, to place equipment that makes the device possible to be controlled remotely

In the end, I collected the pieces on Cinema 4d
